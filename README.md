akka-http-olingo-extension
==========================

- A simple project showing how `ODATA 4.0 services` can be developed using `akka-http` and `Apache Olingo`.

- `akka-http` is a lite framework for developing REST applications in Scala. `Apache Olingo` is a framework which allows implementing Rest services with OData 4.0. 

- The `example` directory contains the sample Olingo project. 

- The class `OdataAkkaHttpHandlerImpl` is extended to integrate Apache Olingo and akka-http. The best of both frameworks can be used now.
